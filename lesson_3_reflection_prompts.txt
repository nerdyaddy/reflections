When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
Ans: To collaborate and backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Ans:
Fork = Copy repository to your account so that you can edit it.
Clone = Create a copy of repository, either local or from github
Branches = Branch out to create a new feature or fix a bug.

Fork whenever you want to work on somebody else's repositoryl.
Clone when you want to work on a copy or copy a github repo to your local.
Branches will be used to create a new feature or keep old code intact.
