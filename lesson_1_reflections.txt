How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

My thoughts: It lest you view the differences quickly and easily.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
My thoughts: It lets you revert to any older version anytime.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
My thoughts: It's a judgement and hence can go wrong. There is no right or wrong.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
My thoughts: Because you can revert to a logical stage of your application.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
My thoughts: Isn't it obvious?
